                    <span  class="e4_17">In May of 2023, I graduated with a BS degree in Geospatial Sciences from Metropolitan State University of Denver. Currently, I’m working on a project as a NASA DEVELOP Team Member in Laramie, Wyoming, while searching for an opportunity to begin a career in spatial science. I have past experience in utility GIS and academia. I am a skilled Python programmer with expertise in a wide array of geospatial software suites.</span>

                    <span  class="e4_17">I am also currently working on a research project with the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at MSU Denver attempting to optimize the location of electric vehicle charging stations in Colorado.</span>

                    <span  class="e4_17">In my personal life, I enjoy nature and outdoor recreation, wildlife conservation, computers, and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.</span><div  class="e4_18"></div><div  class="e4_16"></div><span  class="e4_19">HOME</span><span  class="e4_21">PORTFOLIO</span><span  class="e4_20">RESUME</span><span  class="e4_22">CONTACT</span><div class=e6_12><div  class="e3_3"></div><span  class="e4_5">Hayden Hoffmeister</span><span  class="e4_7">Recent graduate with a degree in Geospatial Sciences.
